## Summary
The visualization was meant to show the approximate market share (using number of flights provided) and size (using active fleet size) of different commerical airlines through the period between 1995 to 2008. Readers should see trends based on specific events during this time period (9/11 and the Great Recession).
This visualization was derived from the US flight data obtained the [ASA](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html).

## Design
I chose to use a mix between a bar char and a bubble chart to show the changes in both the total flights provided (y-axis) from year to year as well as the change in the airline's size (bubble size). A slider as was added at the end of the animation to allow users to choose the year axis themselves an allowd them to explore the data further. I felt that this was a better mechanism than using a series of buttons.
